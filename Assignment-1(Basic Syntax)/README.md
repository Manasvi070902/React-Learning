- Created components: UserInput and UserOutput
- UserInput contains an input element and UserOutput contains paragraph tags
- Passed a "name" to UserOutput via props and display it there
- Added state to the App component (=> the name) and pass the name to the UserOutput component
- Added a method to manipulate the state (=> an event-handler method) and then passed the event-handler method reference to the UserInput component and bind it to the input-change event
- The new input entered by the user overwrites the old username passed to UserOutput
- Added two-way-binding to your input (in UserInput) to also display the starting username
- Learned how to add inline styles and stylesheets to components
